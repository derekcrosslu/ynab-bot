# Sky-Scrapper API Setup Guide

This guide explains how to complete the Sky-Scrapper integration for flight search with price filtering.

## Current Status

✅ **Feature 1: Google Maps Multi-Stop Routes** - COMPLETE
⚠️ **Feature 2: Sky-Scrapper API** - Foundation complete, needs RapidAPI key

---

## What You Have Now

### ✅ Fully Working:
- **Trip plans with Google Maps routes** - Automatically generated
- **Sky-Scrapper MCP Server** - Complete implementation ready
- **TripAgent initialization** - Sky-Scrapper integrated

### ⏳ Needs Completion:
- Get RapidAPI key for Sky-Scrapper
- Update `.env` on server with RAPIDAPI_KEY
- Final `searchFlights()` update for price parsing

---

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Get RapidAPI Key (5 minutes)

1. Go to **https://rapidapi.com/apiheya/api/sky-scrapper**
2. Click "Subscribe to Test"
3. Select a plan:
   - **FREE (Basic)**: ~500 requests/month ← Start here
   - **PRO**: $25/month for more requests
4. Copy your API key (looks like: `abc123xyz456...`)

### 2. Update Server Environment

SSH into your server and add the key:

```bash
ssh root@144.202.27.10
cd /root/ynab-bot
nano .env
```

Add this line:
```
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)

### 3. Deploy Current Changes

Pull the latest code:
```bash
cd /root/ynab-bot
git pull origin main
npm install --prefix mcp-servers/skyscrapper
pm2 restart whatsapp-ynab-bot
```

Check logs:
```bash
pm2 logs whatsapp-ynab-bot --lines 50
```

You should see:
```
🛩️ [TripAgent] Sky-Scrapper API initialized (RapidAPI - All airlines, price filtering)
```

Or if no key set:
```
⚠️ [TripAgent] RAPIDAPI_KEY not set - Sky-Scrapper disabled (falling back to Google Flights links)
```

## Feature 2: Sky-Scrapper Flight Search (After RapidAPI Key Setup)

### Current Behavior (Without RAPIDAPI_KEY):

Flight searches still work using **Google Flights links** (Feature from previous commit):

**Test:**
```
check flights from lima to new york Dec 11-21
```

**Current Result:**
```
✈️ **Flights: LIM → JFK**

📅 Round-trip
📆 Depart: 2025-12-11
🔄 Return: 2025-12-21

🔍 **Search on Google Flights** (All airlines, best prices):
https://www.google.com/travel/flights?q=...

💡 Tap the link above to see all available flights.
```

### After RAPIDAPI_KEY Setup:

Once you add the key, flight searches will use **Sky-Scrapper with price filtering**:

**Test:**
```
check flights from lima to new york Dec 11-21 under $1000
```

**Expected Result (with Sky-Scrapper):**
```
✈️ **5 Flight Options** (Round-trip)
💰 *Filtered: Under USD 1000*

**1. LATAM Airlines** - USD 845
   LIM → JFK (Nonstop)
   Depart: 12/11/2025 12:05 AM
   Arrive: 12/11/2025 8:10 AM
   🔗 Book: [link]

**2. Copa Airlines** - USD 920
   LIM → JFK (1 stop)
   [...]

🔍 **View all options on Google Flights:**
[Google Flights link with price filter]
```

## Final Implementation Step (After API Key Setup)

Once you have the RAPIDAPI_KEY working, I'll help you complete the final piece:

### Update `searchFlights()` method to:

1. **Parse price constraints** from user input:
   - "under $1000" → maxPrice: 1000
   - "less than 800" → maxPrice: 800
   - "max 500 dollars" → maxPrice: 500

2. **Use Sky-Scrapper first** (if initialized):
```javascript
if (this.skyscrapper.initialized) {
    // Call Sky-Scrapper with maxPrice
    const result = await this.skyscrapper.searchFlights({
        origin, destination, departureDate, returnDate,
        adults, travelClass, maxPrice, currency: 'USD'
    });
    if (result.success) {
        return formatted results
    }
}
```

3. **Fall back to Google Flights** if Sky-Scrapper unavailable

## Troubleshooting

### "RAPIDAPI_KEY not set" warning
- Solution: Add key to `.env` and restart bot

### "Rate limit exceeded" (429 error)
- You've hit the monthly limit
- Wait until next month or upgrade plan

### "API key invalid" (403 error)
- Check the key is copied correctly
- Ensure you subscribed to Sky-Scrapper API on RapidAPI

### Flight search still only shows Google Flights link
- Check if Sky-Scrapper initialized: `pm2 logs whatsapp-ynab-bot | grep Sky-Scrapper`
- Verify .env has RAPIDAPI_KEY set
- Restart bot after adding key
